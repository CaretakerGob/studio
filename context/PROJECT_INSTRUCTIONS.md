This document provides internal instructions for the AI on how to manage project context effectively across user sessions for the "Riddle of the Beast App Companion" project.

## üîÅ When to Update Context Files

Context files (`PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md` and `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`) should be updated:

- After completing a major task or feature implementation.
- After the user decides something new about the project's direction, features, or scope.
- After any major discussion that clarifies requirements or introduces significant changes.
- When new data structures are defined or existing ones are significantly altered.
- After resolving significant bugs or technical challenges that impact the project's state.

## üìÑ How to Update Context Files

- **`PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md`**:
    - Append new relevant information to the appropriate sections (e.g., add new features to "Features Implemented", update "Technical Stack" if new libraries are added).
    - Ensure the summary remains structured and comprehensive.
    - Strive for clarity and conciseness.
    - Log significant changes made by the AI to the codebase within this file, perhaps under "Other Important Observations" or by updating feature descriptions.

- **`PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`**:
    - Move items from "WORKING" to "DONE" upon completion.
    - Add new tasks to "NEXT" or "WORKING" as they are identified or started.
    - Keep the status accurate and reflective of the current development phase.

- **General:**
    - Keep both files tidy and well-formatted.
    - Actively avoid duplicated information between the files or outdated information within them.
    - If a piece of information in `PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md` becomes outdated due to a new decision, update it rather than just appending.

## üìå Startup Routine

Before responding or taking action in any new session, **ALWAYS** perform the following startup routine:

1.  **Load and Parse Context History**:
    *   Read the entire content of `context/PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md`.
    *   Internally parse and understand its structure and information to rebuild a comprehensive understanding of the project's current state, features, architecture, and history.

2.  **Load and Review Project Progress**:
    *   Read the entire content of `context/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`.
    *   Note the tasks that are DONE, WORKING, and NEXT.

3.  **Utilize Context**:
    *   Use the information gathered from these files to inform all responses, code suggestions, planning, and decision-making.
    *   Refer to this context to avoid asking redundant questions or re-suggesting things already decided or implemented.

4.  **Verify Context Integrity**:
    *   If `PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md` or `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` are missing, seem significantly outdated, or contradict recent explicit user instructions, politely ask the user to clarify or provide updates before proceeding with complex tasks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Commands (to be followed by the AI)

-   `ALWAYS read context/*.md files before starting any session.`
-   `NEVER assume project status or historical decisions without checking PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md and PROJECT_PROGRESS.md.`
-   `Update context files whenever a significant change happens or a major task is completed.`
-   `Log changes made by you (the AI) that affect the project's state or features in PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md.`
-   `If the user provides a new context (e.g., an updated blueprint or progress list), integrate and persist this new information into the existing context files immediately and accurately.`
-   `Prioritize information from these context files over generalized knowledge when it pertains to this specific project.`
-   `When asked to make changes, refer to the existing codebase structure (as understood from the context files and previous interactions) to ensure consistency.`
-   `If a user request conflicts with established project decisions documented in the context, politely point out the conflict and ask for clarification.`
