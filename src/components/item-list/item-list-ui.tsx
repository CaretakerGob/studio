// This file has been renamed to src/components/events/events-sheet-ui.tsx
// and its content has been moved and updated there.
// This file can be deleted or kept as a placeholder if a different item list UI is planned.
// For now, to avoid breaking existing imports if any were missed by the agent, 
// let's make it re-export the new component.
// However, the primary changes are to create the new file and update direct usages.

export {}; // To make this a module if empty, though it should ideally be deleted.
