- Numerous bug fixes and UI refinements.

WORKING:
- Ongoing review and minor clean-up of existing codebase.
- Refinement of Character Sheet mobile optimization for inner tab content.

NEXT:
- Implement full "Gear and Equipment" system based on rulebook:
    - Character inventory system.
    - Equipment slots on Character Sheet UI.
    - Logic for equipping/unequipping individual items (Gear, Utility, Augments, Consumables).
    - Dynamic stat/ability updates based on equipped items.
- Integrate combat rules into a basic combat UI/tracker.
- Develop "Shared Space" with real-time collaboration features (Firebase) (using "Party" terminology).
- Populate "Item List" page with actual game items (from rulebook or new data source, potentially shop sheet).
- Expand Genkit AI integrations:
    - Dynamic NPC dialogue generation.
    - AI-assisted event or NPC detail generation.
    - Persist AI-generated shop item images.
- Add a bestiary/monster manual section.
- Implement game rule references or a digital rulebook section (current "How to Play" serves this, but could be enhanced).
- Implement Hunter's Nexus "Session Display Preferences" (toggle tool visibility, compact mode).
- **Markdown Rendering**: Clarify if `Rotb_rulebook_dropdown_structure.md` should only define structure while content comes from the main rulebook, or if it's the sole source for "How to Play".
- Further mobile optimization for all pages.
- Caching strategies for Google Sheet data.
- Address any remaining warnings from the build process.
- Refine UI/UX across all pages based on testing.
