# Riddle of the Beast - Meta Builds

This document outlines effective "meta" builds for characters in Riddle of the Beast, combining their inherent strengths with synergistic Arsenal Cards and playstyles.

## Gob - Ranged Tactician

**Character Overview:**
Gob is a versatile hunter excelling in ranged combat and tactical support. His AR-15 provides consistent damage, while his skills (Tactician, Survivalist, Knowledge) allow him to adapt to various situations. His abilities offer a mix of offensive consistency, enemy control, and team support.

**Core Strengths:**
- **Weapon:** AR-15 (A4/R5)
- **Key Skills:** Tactician (3), Survivalist (2), Knowledge (3)
- **Key Abilities:**
    - **Vital Shot (Action):** Enhances AR-15 reliability by re-rolling 2 missed attack dice.
    - **Leadership (Action):** Buffs nearby allies' Attack or Defense.
    - **Flare x3 (Interrupt):** Provides crucial light, negates enemy Stealth, and can be used frequently.
    - **Quick Draw (Interrupt):** Offers battlefield control by pushing enemies back.
    - **Wounding Strike (Action):** A situational melee option that bypasses armor and applies WOUNDED.

**Recommended Arsenal Focus:**
An ideal Arsenal Card for Gob would enhance his ranged capabilities, provide further tactical utility, or bolster his survivability. Look for Arsenals that offer:
-   Bonuses to Ranged Attack or Range.
-   Abilities that Mark targets, making them easier for the team to hit.
-   Items that provide additional defensive utility or limited-use offensive tools (e.g., grenades, specialized ammo).
-   Gear that complements a mobile, ranged playstyle.

**Example Synergistic Arsenal Card Concept: "Marksman's Overwatch Kit"**
*   **Global Modifiers:** +1 to Ranged Attack.
*   **Items/Abilities Granted:**
    *   **Advanced Scope (Gear):** Passive - Attacks against Marked targets deal +1 damage.
    *   **Incendiary Rounds (Bonus Item - Qty 2):** FREE Action - Next Ranged attack deals FIRE damage and may apply BURNING.
    *   **Targeting Binoculars (Action - CD 2):** Mark one enemy within 8 spaces for 2 rounds.
    *   **Light Tactical Vest (Gear):** Passive - +1 Max HP.

**Playstyle:**
1.  **Positioning:** Utilize Gob's Survivalist skill and MV to maintain optimal range with his AR-15, ideally staying out of immediate melee threat.
2.  **Consistent Damage:** Use Vital Shot frequently to ensure his AR-15 attacks land.
3.  **Team Support:** Position Gob near allies to make effective use of Leadership. Deploy Flares strategically to counter darkness or stealthed enemies.
4.  **Control:** Use Quick Draw to create distance or disrupt enemy advances.
5.  **Situational Melee:** Wounding Strike can be effective against heavily armored foes if Gob finds himself in melee, but ranged combat is his primary strength.

**Why this build works:**
This build leans into Gob's natural proficiency with ranged weapons and his tactical acumen. By enhancing his AR-15's effectiveness and providing tools to support his team (Leadership, Flares, Marking from a synergistic Arsenal), Gob becomes a reliable damage dealer and a valuable tactical asset on the battlefield.

## Gob - Close Quarters Disruptor

**Character Overview:**
This build transforms Gob into a nimble melee combatant who excels at getting close to targets, bypassing armor with Wounding Strike, and controlling the flow of combat with Quick Draw. Leadership and Flares remain key support tools.

**Core Strengths:**
- **Weapon:** Knife (A2) / Wounding Strike (A3/R1)
- **Key Skills:** Tactician (3), Survivalist (2), (Consider Athletics if custom points available)
- **Key Abilities:**
    - **Wounding Strike (Action):** Primary melee attack, bypasses armor and applies WOUNDED.
    - **Quick Draw (Interrupt):** Crucial for controlling enemy positioning, creating openings, or peeling for allies.
    - **Leadership (Action):** Buffs nearby allies' Attack or Defense, useful before engaging or during a brawl.
    - **Flare x3 (Interrupt):** Maintains visibility for the team, negates enemy Stealth, useful even in melee.

**Recommended Arsenal Focus:**
An ideal Arsenal Card for this Gob build would enhance his melee effectiveness and survivability in close combat. Look for Arsenals that offer:
-   A superior Melee Weapon or bonuses to Melee Attack.
-   Increased Defense, HP, or damage reduction against melee attacks.
-   Items granting additional movement/repositioning abilities (like Evasive Roll).
-   Close-range debuff items (like Pepper Spray for Blind).
-   Gear that improves Sanity or resistance to status effects common in melee.

**Example Synergistic Arsenal Card Concept: "Shadow Striker's Kit" (Conceptual - Uses existing item ideas)**
*   **Global Modifiers:** +1 to Defense.
*   **Items/Abilities Granted (Inspired by available shop gear):**
    *   **Elite Tactical Knife (Weapon):** Replaces base Knife. Grants A4 Melee. Nimble Class (Quick Strike Interrupt). Critical Hits allow an extra attack (once per turn). (Based on shop item)
    *   **Knee Pad (Gear):** Grants "Evasive Roll" (Interrupt: Move 2 spaces, 1 round CD). (Based on shop item)
    *   **Pepper Spray (Bonus Item - Qty 1):** Interrupt: Blind target (R4) for 1 turn. Consumed. (Based on shop item)
    *   **Stealth Suit (Gear - Passive):** Passive: Lowers Range value of all enemy attacks by 2 when targeting Gob. (Based on shop item)

**Playstyle:**
1.  **Target Prioritization:** Identify key enemies to neutralize with Wounding Strike, especially armored ones.
2.  **Positioning & Engagement:** Use MV, Survivalist, and potentially Evasive Roll (from Arsenal) to close distances safely or disengage.
3.  **Disruption:** Utilize Quick Draw proactively to push enemies out of position, break up formations, or protect vulnerable allies. Use Pepper Spray (from Arsenal) to disable a dangerous foe.
4.  **Team Support:** Apply Leadership to buff allies before major engagements. Use Flares to maintain visibility and counter stealthed enemies.
5.  **Melee Combat:** Rely on Wounding Strike for armor penetration. If an Arsenal provides a weapon like the Elite Tactical Knife, leverage its higher attack and Quick Strike ability for additional attacks or reactions.

**Why this build works:**
This build capitalizes on Gob's often-overlooked melee potential (Wounding Strike, Quick Draw) and his tactical skills. By equipping an Arsenal that enhances his close-quarters capabilities (better weapon, mobility, disruption tools) and survivability, Gob becomes a potent disruptor who can create chaos on the front line while still supporting his team.
