# Riddle of the Beast - Meta Builds

This document outlines effective "meta" builds for characters in Riddle of the Beast, combining their inherent strengths with synergistic Arsenal Cards and playstyles.

## Gob - Ranged Tactician

**Character Overview:**
Gob is a versatile hunter excelling in ranged combat and tactical support. His AR-15 provides consistent damage, while his skills (Tactician, Survivalist, Knowledge) allow him to adapt to various situations. His abilities offer a mix of offensive consistency, enemy control, and team support.

**Core Strengths:**
- **Weapon:** AR-15 (A4/R5)
- **Key Skills:** Tactician (3), Survivalist (2), Knowledge (3)
- **Key Abilities:**
    - **Vital Shot (Action):** Enhances AR-15 reliability by re-rolling 2 missed attack dice.
    - **Leadership (Action):** Buffs nearby allies' Attack or Defense.
    - **Flare x3 (Interrupt):** Provides crucial light, negates enemy Stealth, and can be used frequently.
    - **Quick Draw (Interrupt):** Offers battlefield control by pushing enemies back.
    - **Wounding Strike (Action):** A situational melee option that bypasses armor and applies WOUNDED.

**Recommended Arsenal Focus:**
An ideal Arsenal Card for Gob would enhance his ranged capabilities, provide further tactical utility, or bolster his survivability. Look for Arsenals that offer:
-   Bonuses to Ranged Attack or Range.
-   Abilities that Mark targets, making them easier for the team to hit.
-   Items that provide additional defensive utility or limited-use offensive tools (e.g., grenades, specialized ammo).
-   Gear that complements a mobile, ranged playstyle.

**Example Synergistic Arsenal Card: "Marksman's Overwatch Kit"**
This arsenal uses items available in the shop to enhance Gob's ranged effectiveness.
*   **Global Modifiers:** +1 to Ranged Attack.
*   **Items/Abilities Granted (Shop Items):**
    *   **Precision Scope (Defense Gear - Shop Item):** Passive - Increase Range by 2.
    *   **Incendiary Ammo (Utility - Shop Item, Qty 2 uses granted):** FREE Action - Element of Range Attack is now FIRE for 1 turn.
    *   **Targeting Sight (Utility - Shop Item):** ACTION (2 Charges) - Inflict MARKED Status on Target. Lasts 2 turns.
    *   **Leather Armor (Defense Gear - Shop Item):** Passive - Increase Max HP by 1.

**Playstyle:**
1.  **Positioning:** Utilize Gob's Survivalist skill and MV to maintain optimal range with his AR-15, ideally staying out of immediate melee threat.
2.  **Consistent Damage:** Use Vital Shot frequently to ensure his AR-15 attacks land.
3.  **Team Support:** Position Gob near allies to make effective use of Leadership. Deploy Flares strategically to counter darkness or stealthed enemies.
4.  **Control:** Use Quick Draw to create distance or disrupt enemy advances.
5.  **Situational Melee:** Wounding Strike can be effective against heavily armored foes if Gob finds himself in melee, but ranged combat is his primary strength.

**Why this build works:**
This build leans into Gob's natural proficiency with ranged weapons and his tactical acumen. By enhancing his AR-15's effectiveness and providing tools to support his team (Leadership, Flares, Marking from a synergistic Arsenal), Gob becomes a reliable damage dealer and a valuable tactical asset on the battlefield.

## Gob - Close Quarters Disruptor

**Character Overview:**
This build transforms Gob into a nimble melee combatant who excels at getting close to targets, bypassing armor with Wounding Strike, and controlling the flow of combat with Quick Draw. Leadership and Flares remain key support tools.

**Core Strengths:**
- **Weapon:** Knife (A2) / Wounding Strike (A3/R1)
- **Key Skills:** Tactician (3), Survivalist (2), (Consider Athletics if custom points available)
- **Key Abilities:**
    - **Wounding Strike (Action):** Primary melee attack, bypasses armor and applies WOUNDED.
    - **Quick Draw (Interrupt):** Crucial for controlling enemy positioning, creating openings, or peeling for allies.
    - **Leadership (Action):** Buffs nearby allies' Attack or Defense, useful before engaging or during a brawl.
    - **Flare x3 (Interrupt):** Maintains visibility for the team, negates enemy Stealth, useful even in melee.

**Recommended Arsenal Focus:**
An ideal Arsenal Card for this Gob build would enhance his melee effectiveness and survivability in close combat, using items directly from the shop.
-   A superior Melee Weapon (e.g., Elite Tactical Knife).
-   Increased Defense or HP from Defense Gear.
-   Items granting movement abilities (e.g., Knee Pad).
-   Close-range debuff items (e.g., Pepper Spray).
-   Gear that improves survivability (e.g., Stealth Suit).

**Example Synergistic Arsenal Card: "Shadow Striker's Kit"**
This arsenal is composed of items directly available from the game's shop.
*   **Global Modifiers:** +1 to Defense.
*   **Items/Abilities Granted (Shop Items):**
    *   **Elite Tactical Knife (Melee Weapon - Shop Item):** A4 Melee. Nimble Class (grants Quick Strike Interrupt). If this weapon triggers a Critical Hit you can attack again. Can trigger once per turn.
    *   **Knee Pad (Defense Gear - Shop Item):** INTERRUPT (1 round CD): Evasive Roll - Move 2 spaces in any direction.
    *   **Pepper Spray (Utility Item - Shop Item, Qty 1 charge granted):** INTERRUPT (1 Charge): R4 - Blind target for 1 turn.
    *   **Stealth Suit (Defense Gear - Shop Item):** Passive: Lower Range value of all enemy attacks by 2 when targeting the wearer.

**Playstyle:**
1.  **Target Prioritization:** Identify key enemies to neutralize with Wounding Strike, especially armored ones.
2.  **Positioning & Engagement:** Use MV, Survivalist, and Evasive Roll (from Knee Pad) to close distances safely or disengage.
3.  **Disruption:** Utilize Quick Draw proactively to push enemies out of position, break up formations, or protect vulnerable allies. Use Pepper Spray to disable a dangerous foe.
4.  **Team Support:** Apply Leadership to buff allies before major engagements. Use Flares to maintain visibility and counter stealthed enemies.
5.  **Melee Combat:** Rely on Wounding Strike for armor penetration. Leverage the Elite Tactical Knife's higher attack and Quick Strike ability for additional attacks or reactions.

**Why this build works:**
This build capitalizes on Gob's often-overlooked melee potential (Wounding Strike, Quick Draw) and his tactical skills. By equipping an Arsenal that enhances his close-quarters capabilities with specific shop items (better weapon, mobility, disruption tools) and survivability, Gob becomes a potent disruptor who can create chaos on the front line while still supporting his team.
