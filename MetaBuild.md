# Riddle of the Beast - Meta Builds

This document outlines effective "meta" builds for characters in Riddle of the Beast, combining their inherent strengths with synergistic Arsenal Cards and playstyles.

## Gob - Ranged Tactician

**Character Overview:**
Gob is a versatile hunter excelling in ranged combat and tactical support. His AR-15 provides consistent damage, while his skills (Tactician, Survivalist, Knowledge) allow him to adapt to various situations. His abilities offer a mix of offensive consistency, enemy control, and team support.

**Core Strengths:**
- **Weapon:** AR-15 (A4/R5)
- **Key Skills:** Tactician (3), Survivalist (2), Knowledge (3)
- **Key Abilities:**
    - **Vital Shot (Action):** Enhances AR-15 reliability by re-rolling 2 missed attack dice.
    - **Leadership (Action):** Buffs nearby allies' Attack or Defense.
    - **Flare x3 (Interrupt):** Provides crucial light, negates enemy Stealth, and can be used frequently.
    - **Quick Draw (Interrupt):** Offers battlefield control by pushing enemies back.
    - **Wounding Strike (Action):** A situational melee option that bypasses armor and applies WOUNDED.

**Recommended Arsenal Focus:**
An ideal Arsenal Card for Gob would enhance his ranged capabilities, provide further tactical utility, or bolster his survivability. Look for Arsenals that offer:
-   Bonuses to Ranged Attack or Range.
-   Abilities that Mark targets, making them easier for the team to hit.
-   Items that provide additional defensive utility or limited-use offensive tools (e.g., grenades, specialized ammo).
-   Gear that complements a mobile, ranged playstyle.

**Example Synergistic Arsenal Card Concept: "Marksman's Overwatch Kit"**
*   **Global Modifiers:** +1 to Ranged Attack.
*   **Items/Abilities Granted:**
    *   **Advanced Scope (Gear):** Passive - Attacks against Marked targets deal +1 damage.
    *   **Incendiary Rounds (Bonus Item - Qty 2):** FREE Action - Next Ranged attack deals FIRE damage and may apply BURNING.
    *   **Targeting Binoculars (Action - CD 2):** Mark one enemy within 8 spaces for 2 rounds.
    *   **Light Tactical Vest (Gear):** Passive - +1 Max HP.

**Playstyle:**
1.  **Positioning:** Utilize Gob's Survivalist skill and MV to maintain optimal range with his AR-15, ideally staying out of immediate melee threat.
2.  **Consistent Damage:** Use Vital Shot frequently to ensure his AR-15 attacks land.
3.  **Team Support:** Position Gob near allies to make effective use of Leadership. Deploy Flares strategically to counter darkness or stealthed enemies.
4.  **Control:** Use Quick Draw to create distance or disrupt enemy advances.
5.  **Situational Melee:** Wounding Strike can be effective against heavily armored foes if Gob finds himself in melee, but ranged combat is his primary strength.

**Why this build works:**
This build leans into Gob's natural proficiency with ranged weapons and his tactical acumen. By enhancing his AR-15's effectiveness and providing tools to support his team (Leadership, Flares, Marking from a synergistic Arsenal), Gob becomes a reliable damage dealer and a valuable tactical asset on the battlefield.
