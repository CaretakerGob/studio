# Riddle of the Beast - Game Rules Compilation

## Arsenals

Arsenals are a preset load out of Gear that each Hunter can equip before a mission.
Each Arsenal can only be assigned to 1 Hunter at a time.

**Arsenals and other Gear**
The next section provides rules for players who wish to purchase a variety of Gear and
build their own Arsenals. Arsenal items are locked within their Arsenal and can only
be equipped when using the Arsenal system.
Hunters using an Arsenal have limited Gear Slots Available. Each Hunter with an
Arsenal can only equip the following:
1. Open Slot – Any Gear, Utility, Relic or Consumable
2. Augment – A skill Augment only
See the Gear and Equipment section for more details on Equipment Slots.

## Gear and Equipment

The Riddle of the Beast Campaign Mode offers the players a large variety of equipment and gear to purchase and discover throughout their adventure. Equipment can range from new weapons, consumables to change the elements of an attack, to utility items that can grant a Hunter a brand new ability. Each Hunter can equip up to 4 different items at a time. Hunters also can equip 1 Augment and 1 Consumable item for a total of 6 Equipment Slots. Equipment can be changed after an Investigation or during a Rest. Below is a breakdown of different Equipment types and how they function.

**Equipment Slots** – Each Hunter can equip up to 6 total items at one time. Refer to the below:
1. Open Slot – Any Gear, Utility, Relic or Consumable
2. Open Slot – Any Gear, Utility Relic or Consumable
3. Open Slot – Any Gear, Utility Relic or Consumable
4. Open Slot – Any Gear, Utility Relic or Consumable
5. Augment – A skill Augment only
6. Consumable – A 1 time use Consumable item only

**Gear** - Weapons, armor, shields and other large pieces of equipment fall into this category. Melee/Ranged Weapons do not overwrite the wearer’s current Melee or Ranged value but instead are considered a second weapon that can be used instead of their base value. Before making an attack the player should declare if they are attacking with their base value or the equipped weapon. Armor and shields that provide a Defensive value completely overwrite the user’s current defense value.

**Utility Items** - Utility items can provide the character a new action or interrupt but have a limited amount of uses per battle that is represented by the amount of charges listed. Charges are restored at the end of each battle.

**Relics** - Relics are rare mystical items that can only be used by those knowledgeable in the Occult. Before each use of a Relic the user must roll a successful Occult skill check or the effect fails. Certain Relic's offer more than one special ability to the user with a different skill check requirement for each ability.

**Augments** - Augments improve the Hunter's skill by a set value. As long as the item is equipped the skill is considered at the increased value. Skills increased through the use of Augments can unlock Skill Proficiencies of higher tiers as long as the item is equipped. Hunter’s are limited to 1 Augment equipped at a time.

**Consumables** – Consumable items can only be once and are destroyed after use. A consumable item can be used as an Interrupt unless otherwise indicated.

## Gear Shop

The items below can be purchased with Crypto in between any Investigation. Multiple effects of the same item do NOT stack. Weapons that are purchased can be shared between Hunters but only one Hunter can equip the item unless multiple are purchased. Players should maintain an Inventory sheet to track all purchased or acquired items.
Items that are no longer useful can be resold to the shop at its original value. Items acquired as rewards cannot be sold.

The Gear Shop is broken down into the following Categories.
*   Defense – Increases characters survivability
*   Melee Weapons – Close range weapons
*   Ranged Weapons – Long range weapons

## Status Effects

Any ability that improves or hinders a unit is considered a Status Effect. The nature of the effect can range from Tricks of the Trade Debuff which disables an ability to a Ward buff that will absorb incoming damage. Even Elemental Attacks can be considered Status Effects if they hinder a character for at least 1 turn. A unit can be afflicted with multiple status effects at one time. Refer to each unique ability for more details.

**Buffs** - Positive Status Effects or BUFFS assist a character by improving their attributes or adding a temporary trait or ability. Any unit with a buff that can target an ally can also target themselves with the Buff.

**Debuffs** - Negative Status Effects or DEBUFFS hinder a unit with a debilitating effect or ailment of some kind. Multiple Debuffs can be used on the same target at once but will trigger Immunity from the same status effect for 1 turn.

**Immunity** - Any character afflicted with a Debuff is considered immune to that same type of status effect for 1 turn after the effect ends. Certain Templates and units have natural immunity to specific Debuffs.

### Specific Buffs
*   **Stealth:** Stealth units are treated as twice the normal distance, rounded down, when targeted with a Ranged attack or ability from an enemy. This does not affect allies who are attempted to target the stealth unit. Stealthed hunters can also move through spaces occupied by enemies without triggering attacks of opportunity but still trigger attacks of opportunity if they start their turn adjacent to an enemy and attempt to move.
*   **Cleave:** This ability allows the Attacker to make a melee attack against any enemy units adjacent to Attacker. Roll defense separately for each enemy. This does not target allies. Unless you want to. Because you are a jerk.
*   **Multi-Attack:** Users with this ability can re-roll one combat dice when attacking. This can only occur once per turn. If the new roll is a HIT it can cause the attack to become a Critical Hit. Enemies with Multi-Attack will always re-roll one missed attack roll.
*   **Berserk:** Similar to Multi-Attack but the user can re-roll 2 Attack Dice.
*   **Wards:** Target is protected by a Ward that will absorb the next damage done to them before it will lower their current HP. A Ward of 2 will absorb the next 2 points of damage received.
*   **Cover:** Certain Map Tiles might show objects such as vehicles or barrels that could be used as cover. A unit on the space of one of these items can choose to take the Cover buff as a Free Action. Units behind Cover gain a Ward of 1 from all Ranged Attacks and Abilities while under cover but take +1 damage from Melee Attacks. Leaving Cover - Leaving cover can only occur during the characters Movement phase or when Moved from the space through the use of an Interrupt or Ability. Characters take a -2 penalty to Movement when first leaving cover.
*   **Offering:** Special Location Cards allow Hunters to choose to pay a Penance in order to receive the Offering Buff. Offering allows the Hunter to increase the Rank of their Arsenal card by 1 OR to swap their current Arsenal with a new set, even Advanced Arsenal sets that are still locked. The Offering buff only lasts for the current Investigation and Advanced Arsenals are locked once again at the end of the Investigation. Each Penance can only be used once per Location but a single Hunter can pay the Penance at multiple different Locations in the same Investigation. The Hunter paying the Penance can choose to gift the Offering to another Hunter.

### Renown vs. Infamy
Renown and Infamy are unique Party Wide effects that utilize points earned through Blue and Gray Event and Theme Cards to raise their Rank. Renown of higher ranks can be used to avoid combat while Infamy can be used to trigger battles. Renown and Infamy can both be ranked up together even though the process may prove difficult. Renown and Infamy Ranks only last for the length of the current Investigation.

**Renown** – Renown is a party wide buff that is built up during an Investigation. Certain Event Cards and Theme Cards can cause Renown to accumulate. Renown resets at the start of each Investigation.

| Level | Renown Pts | Ability                                                                                                                                       |
|-------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | 0-2        | N/A                                                                                                                                           |
| 1     | 3-5        | Let's Talk - Roll a Tactics or Empathy check of 5+ to cause an enemy to flee combat. Roll at the start of Battle. Only works on enemies with a CP of 500 or less. Roll for each enemy. |
| 2     | 6-7        | New Recruit - Roll a Personality or Dare Devil check to convince an enemy unit to join your team for the remainder of the Investigation. This can only affect one enemy at a time. Max CP of 750. |
| 3     | 8+         | Karma - All Hunters receive an additional 2 Crypto at the end of the Investigation.                                                             |

### Specific Debuffs
*   **Poison:** Roll 1 Combat Dice. If the result is a HIT the target takes 1 point of damage and cannot defend. On the next turn roll again. Poison lasts for 1 turn unless indicated otherwise. If a DOUBLE SWORD is rolled the Poison continues an additional turn. Effect ends immediately if a MISS is rolled. Multiple uses of Poison on the same target do not stack unless specifically stated on the ability. Targets take a max of 4 damage from Poison before becoming immune for the remainder of the battle. Poison bypasses Template damage reductions but enemies of the Undead Template are immune to Poison.
*   **Paralyze:** Target is paralyzed and cannot move or commit any actions or interrupts for 1 turn. Templates that take more than one Action are locked out until the start of their next turn.
*   **Immobilize/Slow:** Targets movement is lowered by 1 for each Immobilize value on the ability. If the value is greater than the targets max movement then they cannot make a single movement this turn and any excess carries over to the next turn. For example, an Immobilize of 6 on target with a movement of 5 would be completely held for 1 turn and lose 1 to their movement on the next turn. Target can still use any Actions and Interrupts from their current position. Slow abilities lower the targets movement by a set value for consecutive turns. Any Abilities/Passives that proc off of an Immobilize also proc off of a Slow, and vice versa.
*   **Blind:** Target is blinded and must roll a combat dice to see if they can successfully use Ranged Attack or Ability. If the Target is attempting an action with a Range of 1, such as melee, they must roll a HIT before they can continue their action. If they are attempting an Action with a Range value greater than 1 they must first roll a Double Sword or they waste their turn.
*   **Disarmed:** Target cannot make a Melee or Range attack. Disarmed enemies cannot make Attacks of Opportunity. This does not impact ranged Abilities.
*   **Marked:** Attackers targeting a unit afflicted with the Marked status effect can re-roll one missed attack dice per attack. Marked targets cannot benefit from Stealth.
*   **Hex:** Roll 2 Combat Dice. Lower Targets Attack OR Defense by 1 for each HIT rolled.
*   **Wounding:** Wounded Targets take +2 damage from all Physical attacks and Hemorrhage. Wounded effects do not stack unless directly indicated by the ability.
*   **Bleed:** Attacks and abilities that inflict Bleed apply a Bleed Point to the afflicted target and do not have an effect until enough Bleed Points are accumulated to trigger Hemorrhage. Bleed Points can be lowered by certain healing items.

**Hemorrhage** – Once the target is afflicted with enough Bleed Points based off of the table below they are attacked with Hemorrhage and all Bleed Points are reset to 0. Targets cannot roll Defense from Hemorrhage and it bypasses all damage reduction modifiers including Templates. Hunters are all of the BASE template.
Required Bleed Points to Hemorrhage is based off of the targets Template.

| Template              | Bleed Points | Hemorrhage Damage |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| BASE                  | 3            | 3                 |
| UNDEAD                | N/A          | N/A               |
| CREATURE OF THE NIGHT | 3            | 3                 |
| MONSTER               | 4            | 4                 |
| CONDEMNED             | 4            | 4                 |
| BEHEMOTH              | 5            | 5                 |

*   **Defense Debuffs:** Certain abilities such as Hex can lower a target’s Defense Value. This can make the target easier to damage and prevent them from achieving Perfect Defense. A Defense score can never be lowered lower than 1. Multiple Defense Debuffs do not stack but instead increase the duration of the Debuff of the highest value by 1 turn for each application.
*   **Tricks of the Trade:** Disables 1 ability of a target for 1 turn. This only works on skills under the Ability section and has no effect on Ranged Attacks, Melee Attacks, Armor or Templates. Tricks of Trade does not work on SIGNATURE abilities. If a targets ability is disabled through this skill they can still act. Draw another card to see their new action. If the same Card is drawn again then the target loses their turn.
*   **Flinch:** Target rolls -1 DEF and takes +1 DMG from the next attack against them. Flinch can stack with other Debuffs but multiple effects of Flinch do not stack.

**Infamy** – Infamy is a party wide Debuff that is built up during an Investigation. Certain Event Cards and Theme Cards can cause Infamy to accumulate. Infamy resets at the start of each Investigation.

| Level | Infamy Pts | Ability                                                                                                                   |
|-------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | 0-2        | N/A                                                                                                                       |
| 1     | 3-5        | Let's Fight - Hunters can force a fight with any Ambushers at the current Location.                                         |
| 2     | 6-7        | Reckless - All Hunters can make 1 Free Melee or Range Attack per turn but lower their DEF by 1. Increase Risk Score of all Locations by 1. |
| 3     | 8+         | Tagging In - CAMEO CHARACTER - Curtis Kaine replaces one current Hunter for the remainder of the Investigation.             |

## Elemental Attacks

All attacks in Riddle of the Beast are assigned an elemental property that can potentially trigger different effects and potential greater/lesser damage based off of the defenders armor type or template. Certain elements have a Basic effect that always occurs when an enemy is targeted by it and a Special effect that only occurs under certain conditions.

**Physical**
All Melee and Ranged Attacks are considered Physical (Earth) Element unless indicated otherwise by an equipped item. If an attack does not clearly indicate an element it should be considered Physical by default. Physical Attacks that score a Critical Hit process differently than all other elements. See Critical Hits for more details.

**Fire**
The most destructive of the Primal elements and tied to the Astral South. The element of fire can burn and incinerate any touched by its raw energy.
*   Basic Effect – Target takes 1 extra point of damage. Damage is determined after the attack is already rolled but before Defense is rolled. Targets resistant to FIRE damage are immune to this extra damage.
*   Special - Roll 1 Combat Dice prior to the player rolling an attack of the FIRE element. If a Double Sword is rolled the target catches on fire and is considered BURNING. At the beginning of their next turn they must re-roll for damage from the original fire attack and for FIRE status effect. Burning can occur for a max of two turns. An ICE attack against a target that is burning dispel

**Electricity**
Electricity is the most profound manifestations of the Primal element of Air that is tied to the Astral East. Those who can control this graceful but devastating force can unleash an unavoidable onslaught.
*   Basic Effect – Target rolls 1 less defense when defending from this attack.
*   Special - Roll 1 Combat Dice prior to the player rolling an attack of the ELEC element. If a Double Sword is rolled the attack arcs to another target of the attackers choice that is within 4 spaces of the original target. If the attack is an AOE or BEAM roll separately for each target effected.

**Ice**
Primal Water is often associated with its life giving effects but one must not ignore its potency for death and pain. Ice is the most common form of the deadly use of this element tied to the Astral West.
*   Basic Effect – Targets Movement and Damage is lowered by 1 for 1 turn. This triggers even if the target is not damaged.
*   Special - Roll 1 Combat Dice prior to the player rolling an attack of the ICE element. If a Double Sword is rolled the target is FROZEN for 2 turns.
    *   FROZEN - Target cannot achieve Perfect Defense and physical Critical Hits against this target inflict an extra x1 multiplier for critical damage.

**Ether**
Ether is the positive energy or Yin that empowers life and binds together the Prime Elements of Fire, Electricity and Ice. If an Ether attack successfully damages an enemy with the Creature of the Night/Undead/Condemned Template and they are damaged by an Ether attack they are treated as a BASE Template for 1 turn. See Templates for further details.
An enemy damaged by an Ether attack is considered PRIMED and any FIRE/ELEC/ICE Status effects targeting a Primed enemy triggers on a HIT. This lasts for 2 turns.

**Nether**
The Nether element is the negative energy that fuels death, destruction and decay, an abyssal void of nothingness that exists is in a state of metaphysical non-existence. The Nether can be a conduit formulated deep within the dark recesses of the psyche. Traumatic events and acts of extreme violence can formulate Breaches that connect to this great chaotic nothingness. But great and unimaginable dangers dwell within this void. These malevolent entities can be the gravest but most mysterious of forces and woe befalls any unfortunate enough to encounter them.
If an attacker deals at least 1 point of Nether damage to an enemy, the target cannot benefit from any healing effects until the beginning of the attackers next turn. Targets damaged by Nether suffer from DECAY for 2 turns.
DECAY - Targets afflicted by Decay take +1 damage from all attacks.

## A Dark World…

In this section you will find details on various gameplay mechanics that impact the Riddle of the Beast world and fill it with an ever present danger. From the random risks of drawing a Clash Card, to the dangers of the darkness or deadly enemy templates. Nowhere is safe.

**Light and Darkness**
Understanding Light and Darkness is crucial to surviving in the world of Riddle of the Beast. Each Location card indicates the amount of Light Sources present at that location. The amount of Light available on a map tile is represented by the Light Score and this score applies to the entire map piece.

**Light Sources**
When a new Location card is drawn with a Light Source of 1 the players can place a Light icon on any tile on this Location. Certain items such as Lanterns or the Flare ability are treated as a Light Source. Certain Clash Cards or enemy abilities can destroy Light Sources.

**Light - Light Score +1**
Any map tile with a Light Source on them is in Light and possesses a Light Score of +1. This is considered a well lit area and certain enemies such as Creatures of the Night and Undead are hindered while on a lit tile. (See Templates for more details).

**Dark - Light Score 0**
Any map tile that does not contain a Light Source is considered Dark and has a Light Score of 0. This is considered Darkness and where the Hunters must be most vigilant as they are at their greatest risk of madness or death. Any Hunter in the Darkness takes a penalty of -1 to DEFENSE and to SANITY checks.

**Creating and Destroying a Light Source**
Hunters can add a Light Source to the map with certain items available in the Gear section of the game. Certain abilities, such as Flare, also create a Light Source.
Light Sources can be destroyed by Clash Cards, Enemy Abilities or intentionally by a Hunter. To destroy a Light Source a Hunter must complete an Engineering check of 4+ or Attack the Light Source. Each Light Source has HP of 2 and a Defense of 2. Light Sources are only attacked when intentionally targeted and not impacted by Beam or AOE attacks unless intentionally targeting the Light Source.

## Combat Rules

### Initiative
During Investigations, no active human takes control of the decision making of the enemies. To determine initiative for the first turn, one player will roll 1d6 for the Hunters while another will roll for the enemies. Whichever group has the higher roll will go first in the turn order. Reroll on a tie. This will not change for the rest of this battle.

### Player Turn
During the players round of the combat phase they will be available to use a movement, action and interrupt for each Hunter on the map. All Hunters can be moved during this turn and in any order. Coordination and strategy will be crucial for success against the more challenging encounters. When all players are finished making their choices it will move to the enemy turn.

### Enemy Turn
The enemies’ actions and decisions are decided by drawing a separate Combat Card for each enemy unit in play. Players should divide the enemy units on the map in order to keep track of their HP and stats. Enemy units do NOT trigger attacks of opportunities. Hunters still do. Hunters can use an Interrupt during this phase if available.

### Combat Cards
At the start of the enemies turn the players should shuffle the Combat Card deck and draw 1 card for each enemy unit. Draw 2 cards for enemies with templates that indicate 2 Actions per turn. Cards should be drawn in order of enemies CP level. Lowest CP unit will act first and Highest CP units will act last. Once the Combat Card is drawn the enemy will commit the corresponding action or ability as indicated. Below is a summary of the standard enemy actions.
*   MELEE – Enemy unit will attack a Hunter using its Melee Attack Value
*   RANGE – Enemy unit will attack a Hunter using its Base Range Attack Value
*   SPECIAL 1 or 2 – Enemy will trigger one of their unique special skills. This could be an Attack, Heal, Buff or Debuff.
*   SIGNATURE – The enemy will unleash its strongest skill that could have devastating effects on the battlefield. Remember that SIGNATURE skills cannot be stopped with Tricks of the Trade.

Each turn the enemy will move and attempt to reach the closest unit as indicated by their Logic value. If the card indicates a Ranged Attack or Ability the enemy will move to the minimum space needed to hit their target that fits their Combat Logic. If the ability can impact multiple Hunters the enemy should move into the space that would expose the most hunters to the attack.

### Combat Logic
Combat Logic is the attacking units target preference. Logic is listed in the priority order of who a unit would target when attacking the Hunters. For instance, a unit with logic showing “MALE > CLOSEST > HIGHEST HP” indicates that the unit would first move toward a Male unit, even if a Female unit is closer. If multiple Males are on the map the unit will then move to the Closest Male Unit. If there are multiple males within the same distance the unit will target the Hunter with the Highest HP.
Players are encouraged to play the enemies as if they were their own character when small choices need to be made but otherwise the rules on each Card should drive the enemies movements and actions.

> "What is the Beast? Is it a mythical dragon or biblical ten horned behemoth; or perhaps it is a warning from those of days past to the many nightmares that truly exist beyond the scope of what our brittle and fragile psyches accept as normal. However, as I study the works of previous generations of hunters I find unease to see how many of our predecessors speak of the Beast. Not as if they are speaking of some creature or monstrosity, but as if they are referring to something much more horrific." -Gob
> You can use the enemies Logic to your advantage but don’t cheat!
> Don’t be a loser.

### Cruelty
Certain Combat Cards indicate CRUELTY and will overwrite the Logic of the attacker to target the Hunter with the LOWEST HP. The enemy will move and attack the Hunter with the Lowest Health Points that is within range, regardless of its normal Logic Value.

### Combat Basics (Player Turn)
During a players turn they can utilize all of their characters in their given round and choose any order in which to use them. Each of the player’s characters can commit an ACTION and a MOVEMENT in the same round. Certain units also have special INTERRUPTS that do not count as their normal action. During each round the player should follow the below rules for each character they control. A players turn ends once all of their characters have moved and committed an action or if the player chooses to end it before hand. Certain dangerous templates allow a unit to commit more than one movement/action on specific turns. See Templates for more details.

*   **Movement:** The player can begin or end each characters turn by choosing to move the unit. Each character can move a number of spaces up to their max movement value which is found on their character card. A character can move through a space occupied by a friendly unit but not one occupied by a hostile unit. Whether friendly or hostile, two characters cannot occupy the same space.
*   **Actions:** There are multiple options for a unit to commit during their given turn. This could vary from attacking another unit to using a special ability such as a Heal or status effect.
*   **FREE ACTION:** Certain abilities marked as Free Actions can be used when triggered and do not count as an Action or Interrupt. Even when used during an enemies turn. Using a held Clash Card for instance counts as a Free Action and can be played at anytime. Even during an enemies turn.
*   **Attacking:** Once a character is in range to attack a hostile target the player should declare unit is the Attacker and which unit is the Defender.
*   **Rolling the Dice:** Check the value of the attack on the Attacker’s character card to determine how many Combat Dice can be rolled by the Attacker. Some units can have multiple methods to attack an enemy, see below for details on the different attack types. Once an attack is chosen and rolled by the attacking player, the defending player should check their Defender’s stats to determine how many Combat Dice they can roll to block the incoming damage.

### Attack Types
Attacks in RotB are divided into 3 types of attacks. Melee, Ranged, and Special Abilities. Each form of attack offers certain advantages and disadvantages. See below for more details of each attack type.

*   **Melee:** Melee attacks represent short ranged close quarter attacks that can only hit the spaces adjacent to the attacking character. The number of Attack Dice the character can use in a melee attack can be found on their character card next to the Melee icon. Melee Attacks are considered physical unless an item indicates otherwise.
    *   **Engaging and Disengaging:** Once a Character moves into Melee range of an opposing character both units are now considered Engaged. To Disengage from the enemy unit exposes the fleeing character to an Attack of Opportunity. See Attacks of Opportunity below for more details.
*   **Ranged attacks:** Ranged attacks can represent a variety of physical attacks from high caliber sniper rifles, primitive bows and arrows to spikes fired from a beast. On the characters card for a range attack you will see two values in the following format A/R, where A represents the Attack value of the weapon and R represents its Range. One limit of Ranged attacks is that any attacks while an enemy is adjacent to the attacker will trigger an attack of opportunity against the shooter.
*   **Special Abilities:** Special abilities represent a wide range of attacks from a mystical assault to a powerful rocket. Abilities can target enemies at a distance similar to Ranged attacks. Special abilities can also attack multiple units, see Beams and AOEs below. One limit of Special Abilities is that they can be disabled through certain other abilities such as Tricks of the Trade. Special Abilities can be of any element. See Elements and Armor below.
    *   **Beams:** Beams are a special type of special attack that can represent anything from a flame thrower to a powerful shotgun blast. They function identical to a ranged special attack however a beam attacks all targets, friendly and hostile alike that are caught within its path of fire. This allows a beam to potentially hit multiple targets. Roll separate Attack and Defense Dice for each target in the beams path. Beam abilities have a 2 round cool down unless used as an Interrupt or indicated otherwise.
    *   **Area of Effect (AOE):** An Area of Effect, or AOE for short, function, very similarly to a beam. An AOE also falls under the Special Ability attack category and has the ability to attack multiple targets that are caught in its blast radius. For an AOE attack the attacking character can choose a space within the range. The AOE not only attacks the target in the targeted space but also any friendly or hostile units in any adjacent space. All AOE abilities have a 2 round cool down unless used an Interrupt or indicated otherwise.

### Attack of Opportunity
If a unit* attempts to disengage, move past an adjacent enemy or use a Ranged Attack or Ability while adjacent to an enemy unit they expose themselves to an Attack of Opportunity. If this occurs, roll 1 Combat dice, the unit takes 1 Damage if a HIT is rolled and does not roll for Defense. An enemy unit that is PARALYZED or DISARMED cannot make an Attack of Opportunity. Interrupts also do not trigger Attacks of Opportunity. \*Only Player controlled units are vulnerable to Attacks of Opportunity.

### Critical Hits
The Critical Hit system is designed to give more variables to the attack dice roll which can potentially lead to even greater damage. For a critical hit to occur the attacking player must roll all HITs on their attack roll AND have a minimum Attack of 2 for PHYSICAL attacks and 3 for ELEMENTAL attacks. It does not matter if the roll is Single or Double Swords as long as no Misses are rolled. Critical Hits function differently based off of the Attack Type used to score the hit. See Elemental Effects for more details. If an attack does not indicate an element you should assume it is PHYSICAL.
*   **PHYSICAL:** Critical Hits caused by a physical attack such as a sword, bullet or bite allows the attacking player to reroll their Attack Dice and add this additional value to their previous roll. This can potentially lead to double damage. Certain status effects can increase the Critical Multiplier. This is the amount of times the attack dice is rolled on a Critical Hit. Most physical critical hits have a multiplier of x2 which indicates that the dice will be rolled once for the initial attack and on a critical hit it will be rolled again for a second time.
*   **ELEMENTAL:** Critical Hits caused by elemental attacks such as a flame thrower, or lightning blast, function differently than those caused by physical attacks. In this case the attacking character can choose to either accept their original Attack value roll OR they can choose to reroll their attack and bypass the defenders armor and prevent them from rolling any defense dice to block the attack. If the attacker chooses to bypass the armor they must accept the new roll even if no Hits are scored.

### Perfect Defense
Perfect Defense system allows for Defenders to hold their ground and potentially shrug off any damage. A Perfect Defense is achieved when the Defending character rolls a Total Defense Value of 3 or more. If this occurs the Defender negates ALL damage from the Attacker, even if is greater than 3. This cannot occur against attacks that deny the Defender the opportunity to defend, such as an Elemental Critical Hit.
Units with a Defense score of 6 or greater cannot achieve Perfect Defense.

### Attack Value vs. Damage Value
Attack Value indicates the amount of Combat Dice you roll when Attacking. Damage Value indicates the final calculated damage number after the Attack Value is rolled and all damage modifiers are added or subtracted to the roll. Critical Hits only double the initial Attack Value and Defense lowers the Damage Value.
See Damage Modifiers for more details

*Example 2: Advanced Combat*
Cassandra, rolls a Ranged Attack with a value of 3 against an enemy with a Defense Value of 4. Cassandra rolls 3 HITS scoring a Ranged Critical Hit. She rolls 3 Attack Dice once again and rolls 2 additional HITS scoring a total Attack Value of 5. The enemy rolls 2 Shields and 2 Blanks scoring a total BLOCK Value of 2 and takes 3 damage. If the enemy had rolled another Shield he would have achieved Perfect Defense and taken 0 Damage.

## Ability Cool Downs

Certain abilities and Cards trigger an effect called the Cool Down (CD) period. This indicates a number of turns that must pass before the ability can be used again. Beams and Area of Effect attacks are the prime example of abilities that require a cool down after use. Unless stated otherwise a standard cool down lasts 2 turns after the character uses the ability. The ability does not go on cool down if it is interrupted prior to a successful use. The cool down lowers by 1 at the start of each turn and the ability is available once again at the start of the turn once the cool down period has passed.
Characters can have multiple abilities with Cool Downs and each CD is treated independently from other abilities. So if a character uses a Beam attack ability such as Fei’s Flame Thrower with a 2 round CD he can still use an AOE attack ability such as his Shock Grenade with its own 2 round CD on the next turn. Each CD is treated separately.
Abilities such as Tamara’s Team Player can push another Hunter to use an ability even if on Cool Down and does not trigger an additional CD. The CD for Team Player is simply tied to itself.
Interrupts on a Cool Down have an infinite amount of uses.

## Interrupts

Certain abilities are considered Interrupts or Instant abilities. In a normal round a character can move and commit one action, whether it is an attack or ability use. Interrupts function independently from the typical round format because they can be used any time, even during an opponent’s turn. Two main drawbacks exist for Interrupts:
1.  Interrupts are limited in supply or have a Cool Down; this is marked on the individual character card showing how many times per battle a character can utilize that ability.
2.  While an Interrupt is not considered a characters Action in the combat round, each character can still only use one Interrupt per turn. This resets when the Player starts there next turn. Interrupts on a cool down are not consumed upon use.
3.  Declaring an Interrupt: Whether a player chooses to use an Interrupt in their own turn or during opponents, they should always first declare this out loud by stating “Interrupt.” Once the Interrupt has been declared the Player can choose when the effect should occur. The Interrupt does not have to affect the currently used character but the target must be within range of the character that possesses the Interrupt. If two players declare at the same time the tie always goes to the player who is NEXT in the turn order.
    a.  Special Note: The only time an Interrupt cannot be used is once an Attacker has already rolled their Attack Dice. Interrupts should be used to prevent or hinder Attacks that have not occurred yet, not ones in which the results have already been revealed. There are few exceptions to this rule.

*Example 3: Interrupts:*
The Attacking Player moves their Thug enough spaces to enter Melee Range with a Hunter, Fei. The Defending Player Declares “Interrupt!” (Yes he shouted.) Even though the Attacker has already moved adjacent to the Hunter, the Defender can now declare what Interrupt they will use and when in the Attackers movement path the Interrupt will be applied, as long as the target space is within range. Fei uses Paralyze and chooses it to be applied during the movement path as shown. The Thug is now unable to finish their movement or complete an action due to Paralyze.

## Abilities of Note

This section covers certain key abilities that are utilized by the Hunters and their effects in combat. Abilities for Cameo Characters are Italicized.
*   **Sneak Attack (Michael):** Target rolls a max of 1 Defense when attacked by Sneak Attack. If the target is also afflicted with a Defense Debuff it is applied to the Max Defense and not the lowered value used by Sneak Attack. Sneak Attack inflicts Physical damage and can Critically Hit. Michael can use Sneak Attack as a Melee or Range Attack.
*   **Team Player (Tamara):** Team Player does not work on any Actions that take more than one turn to trigger but will work even if the allies ability is on Cool Down. Tamara cannot use Team Player on herself.
*   **Potion of Amplification (Tamara):** Player controlling Tamara can place a Fog Cloud icon anywhere within range. Any abilities that are used on a space within the fog cloud now impact all units within the cloud and are considered an AOE. This ability impacts all abilities used within the clouds range. A heal used within the cloud will now be an AOE, but a Flame Thrower used in the cloud would now go the full Beam range and then trigger an AOE to any in the cloud. This could include harming allies.
*   **Barricade (Blake):** Place Barricade icon on Map. Barricade has 2 HP and 2 Defense. Ranged attacks must destroy the barricade before attacking any adjacent units. Any units adjacent to the Barricade can also choose to use the Barricade to gain the COVER Buff. Blake is immune to the Leaving Cover penalties if using his Barricade for Cover. See Cover under buff for more details.
*   **Anoint Weapon (Cassandra):** Changes the targets next melee or ranged attack to the ETHER element for 1 turn. All base melee and ranged attacks for the Hunters are considered Physical but if they are anointed they are now considered ETHER and bypass Physical resistant armor while also triggering the ETHER element effect. See Elemental attacks below. Attacks by Anointed weapons are still considered Physical for determining Critical Hits and use the Critical Multiplier to determine damage.
*   ***Blood Rite and Blood Arts (Mathias):*** Mathias possesses the unique ability to replicate enemy skills. Once an enemy has been damaged by Mathias’ Bite attack he permanently learns their Special 1 skill due to his Blood Rite Passive. Once a skill is learned it can be assigned to one of Mathias’ Blood Art slots. The enemy skills must be assigned before each Battle but can be chosen from the entire repertoire of learned Blood Rites. Blood Arts of defeated enemies can be purchased for 1 Crypto per 100 CP, rounded up, of the enemy but only if the enemy has been killed in battle before.
*   ***Compulsion (Serenity):*** Serenity beguiles an enemy unit of 250 CP or less that fails a Sanity check to become her pet. Serenity can attempt this ability multiple times per Investigation until it is successful, but she can only gain 1 pet per Investigation/Mission. Beguiled Pets should be written down and stored as new inventory for Serenity and available to her for future missions. Serenity can only bring 1 Pet to each mission.
    *   **Pets:** All Pets have the same stats and abilities as recorded in the Horror Journal and can use 1 Action per turn but this consumes Serenity’s Interrupt Action for that turn as she issues them a command. Use the Skirmish Mode rules for how often Pets can use their Specials and Signatures.
    *   **Pet Ranks and Death:** Pets start at Rank 0 and gain a rank for each successful Investigation they participate in. This does not include the Investigation when they were first compelled. Serenity must also tend to her Pets as they suffer from perma-death and if they reach 0 HP they are dead and should be removed from her Inventory.
    *   **Pet Rank Table:**
        | Pet Ranks | Ability/Passive                                                |
        |-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
        | 0         | RUN AWAY: Pet at edge of the Map can flee the Investigation but does not gain a Rank. |
        | 1         | PASSIVE: Pet gains +2 HP                                       |
        | 2         | COME MY PET: Pet and Serenity gain +1 DEF while adjacent to each other. |
        | 3         | PASSIVE: Pet can now equip an Arsenal                          |

## Skills and Proficiencies (Specific Character Abilities)

### Forage (Joe)
Player can choose to Forage at each Location to find special Herb to buff himself or his teammates. Joe can Forage once per Location and each Hunter can only benefit from 1 Herb at a time. Each Herb lasts for the remainder of the Investigation once used but can be stored for future missions. Foraging requires the Hunters to roll for Ambush.

### Bounties (Joe)
When character is not foraging he is busy tracking bounties on dangerous criminals and beasts. During an Investigation he can use Clues to track down these targets and gain extra Crypto rewards. Add the Crypto Bonus from both tables results to get the final total. Clues used for Bounties do not count for Investigation objectives!
*   **TRAIT 1** - Once the first Clue is spent on the Bounty the player will roll on the Bounty Trait 1 Table below to see one of the targets traits. Targets CP does not change regardless of traits.
*   **TRAIT 2** - Clue 2 will be used to determine the targets Trait 2 and Location.

### Trigger Happy (Curtis Kaine)
Trigger skills can be used like normal Abilities or Interrupts but thanks to CK’s Passive he can also use them instantly as a Free Action if the Debuff listed with the Trigger is used on an enemy within range. For instance if an enemy is knocked back by CK or an ally within range it will allow him to use Trigger Happy to fire a Range Attack for FREE against this target since the trigger is KNOCKBACK. This Ranged Attack can then inflict a BLEED with a Critical Hit which is the trigger for Leg Shot and Arm Shot. The target of the Free Actions must always be the enemy afflicted with the Trigger itself.

### Vigilante Justice (Curtis Kaine)
Base Ranged Attacks are considered his Range Attack Value on the front of his card with the Dual Glocks, Thelma and Luis. His attack Abilities such as Armor Piercing Shot and Leg/Arm Shot does not trigger the Bleed effect. Bullet Storm however allows him to make multiple attacks with his Base Range Weapons and these do trigger the Bleed effect from Vigilante Justice if they critically hit.

### Card Casting (Nysa)
The gypsy Nysa has the unique ability to cause supernatural effects by drawing from her special deck of cards. Nysa players will use the Clash Card deck that is normally drawn before each Event to control Nysa’s power.
*   **Starting Cards:** Nysa starts the game with 3 random Clash Cards in hand. Nysa can hold a max of 7 cards at one time. Extra cards must be buried.
*   **Drawing Cards:** Nysa can automatically draw 1 Clash Card as a Free Action at the start of each turn in Battle. The Weaver of Fate Passive skill allows Nysa to also take cards that are drawn before Events or by enemy Abilities and hold them in hand as long as she has enough space available.
*   **Playing Cards:** Nysa can use the Play Card Action to trigger the Light or Dark side effect of any Clash Cards in hand. Each card is buried after 1 use.
*   **Special Cards:** Certain Clash Cards trigger unique effects when used with the Play Card ability.
    *   Key Moment – Nysa can use this Card simultaneously with another Clash Card. The Key Moment card is buried while the other card is protected for 1 more use.
    *   You are Hunted – Nysa can mulligan up to 5 cards in hand and instantly draw a replacement for each card buried with the Mulligan.
*   **Buried Cards:** Once a card has been buried, either by Nysa or due to an Event or an enemy ability, the player can place the discarded cards into Arcana formations that unlock new Abilities for Nysa.

ACTION – Once Nysa has placed all Clash Cards into the above Arcanas and they are all formed into the Great Arcana she can unlock her greatest potential by summoning the spirits of powerful adversaries trapped within the Tarot.
*   **Tarot Summoning:** Once the Great Arcana is formed Nysa can randomly draw one of the Tarot cards containing the 18 adversaries. Once one is drawn she forms a bond to the spirit and can now use its following abilities as her own Actions.
