## What to Expect...

### Welcome to Riddle of the Beast
Welcome to Riddle of the Beast, a world where urban legends, ancient conspiracies, and mythological horrors bleed into the shadows of the modern world.

- Each Hunt lists the Target, Rank, and starting Location.
- The Hunt also tells you whether it takes place during Day or Night.

### Build Your Team
- Select up to 4 Hunters from the character roster.
- Equip each Hunter with an Arsenal.
- Record each Hunter’s HP and Sanity.

### Prepare for Combat
- Set up the Map and place the Hunters and Target on the Starting Location listed on the Hunt.
- Begin Round 1 by drawing a Clash Card, refer to the Light or Dark side based on the Hunt’s Day/Night setting.
- Roll for initiative to see whether the Hunters or Target starts the round.

### Victory and Defeat
- A Hunt ends when all enemies are defeated, or all Hunters are Incapacitated.
- Surviving the Hunt may reward you with Crypto, currency that can be used to upgrade Arsenal Ranks and purchase new Gear in the Gear shop.

## Light and Darkness
In Riddle of the Beast, the balance between Light and Darkness shapes the horrors that emerge and the Hunters' ability to survive them. Whether bathed in sunlight or cloaked in shadow, the environment influences sanity, abilities, and the effectiveness of supernatural forces.
In Hunt Mode, the scenario itself dictates whether the battle takes place during Day or Night, and that condition remains in effect for the entire Hunt.

### Day
**Light Conditions:** The world is illuminated, providing safety and reducing risks.

**Effects:**
- Hunters do not suffer penalties to Defense or Sanity Checks.
- Certain enemies, such as Creatures of the Night and Undead, are weakened in Light (refer to Templates for details).

### Night
**Dark Conditions:** The world is shrouded in darkness, heightening danger and exposing Hunters to greater threats.

**Effects:**
- Defense Penalty: Hunters take -1 to DEFENSE in the Darkness.
- Sanity Checks: All Sanity Rolls are made with -1 during Night.
- Enemies like Undead and Creatures of the Night gain bonuses in the Dark (see Templates for details).

### Strategic Challenges
Use Light Sources strategically to mitigate penalties and create safe zones.

### Creating Light Sources
Hunters can create Light Sources to counteract the dangers of Night using Abilities such as Flare and Gear. Light Sources illuminate a small radius, providing safety for the Hunters and hindering certain enemies.

## Clash Cards
Clash Cards represent the chaotic, shifting nature of the world—introducing sudden events, supernatural twists, or unexpected turns in combat. Each card has two sides: Light and Dark, and the chosen Hunt will determine which side is used.

### Using Clash Cards in a Hunt
- At the start of each round, draw 1 Clash Card.
- Apply its effect immediately, or hold it if the card allows.
- The Hunt will indicate whether the battle takes place during Day or Night.
- Refer to the appropriate side of the card:
    - Light Side (Top): Typically beneficial—providing healing, buffs, or protective boons.
    - Dark Side (Bottom): Usually harmful—inflicting Debuffs, hazards, or disruptive effects.
- No two battles feel the same. Clash Cards force Hunters to adapt, rethink, and survive the unexpected.

### Types of Clash Cards
- **BUFFS** - Buff cards offer temporary advantages. Some trigger instantly; others can be held and played later. Cards with the HAND icon may be played once as a FREE ACTION on your turn.
- **DEBUFFS** - Debuffs represent setbacks—traps, misfires, fear effects, or strange occurrences. Unless the card specifies otherwise, the player who drew it chooses which unit suffers the effect.
- **SIDE QUESTS** – Side quests are special cards that offer additional battle risks but also additional rewards.

## Sanity and Madness
In Riddle of the Beast, violence is only part of the danger. Hunters face horrors that strain the mind as much as the body. Inspired by the spirit of H.P. Lovecraft, this game doesn’t just threaten your health—it challenges your sanity.

### Sanity
- Every Hunter has a Sanity score, listed on their Character Card. This represents their mental resilience in the face of trauma, fear, and the supernatural.
- Sanity Loss can occur through abilities, events, or Clash Cards.
- If a Hunter’s Sanity is reduced to 0, they fall into Madness.

### Sanity Checks
Certain effects may require a Sanity Check.
To perform a Sanity Check:
- Roll 1d6.
- If the result is greater than the Hunter’s current Sanity, they lose 1 Sanity.
- A roll of 6 is always a failure, and a 1 is always a success, regardless of the current score.
- The lower a Hunter’s Sanity, the more likely they are to fail.

### Madness
When a Hunter reaches 0 Sanity, they suffer the following penalties for the rest of the Hunt or Investigation:
- Lose access to their Passive Skill
- Cannot roll Perfect Defense
- **Optional Rule:** If using the Riddle of the Beast App, ignore the Madness penalty and draw a Madness Card instead.

### Enemy Sanity
Most enemies are already twisted beyond reason—but some still have a Sanity stat and can be pushed to their limit.
If an enemy’s Sanity is reduced to 0, they gain the Psychosis Debuff.

### Psychosis
Enemies under the effect of Psychosis can no longer use their Signature ability. If the Signature card is drawn they waste their turn. Enemies without a starting Sanity Score are immune to Psychosis.

## Combat Basics
Combat in Riddle of the Beast is a tactical exchange of movement, timing, and risk. Each player controls a team of Hunters during the Hunter Round, choosing how and when each one moves, acts, or reacts.
- Hunters may act in any order, but each can perform:
    - One Movement (up to their MV value)
    - One Action
    - One Interrupt (if available)
Once all Hunters have acted—or the player chooses to end early—the round passes to the enemy. Some powerful enemies may take multiple actions per round based on their Template (see the Templates section for more).

### Movement
Hunters may move up to their Movement (MV) value during their turn. Movement can occur before or after taking an Action.
Hunters can move through friendly units but not through enemies.
A unit cannot end its movement in the same space as any other unit.
Terrain, abilities, and Debuffs (e.g., Slow, Immobilize) can affect movement.

### Actions
Each Hunter may perform one Action during their round. Actions include:
- Attacking an enemy.
- Using an Ability (e.g., healing, applying a Status Effect).
- Interacting with the environment (e.g., setting a trap, activating a device).

### Free Actions
Some abilities are marked as Free Actions, meaning they:
- Do not consume your standard Action or Interrupt.
- Can be used at any time, including during the Enemy Round.

### Attacking
When a Hunter attacks a target in range, resolve the attack in the following steps:
1.  **Declare Attacker & Target:** Choose a Hunter to attack and an enemy to defend.
2.  **Determine Dice Pool:** Use the Hunter’s attack stat (Melee or Ranged) to determine how many dice to roll. The target’s Defense value determines how many dice they roll to defend.
3.  **Roll & Resolve:** Both sides roll. Successes from the Defender are subtracted from the Attacker’s. Any remaining successes = damage dealt to the target.

### Attacking with Combat Dice
When attacking a player can find 3 different possible outcomes.
-   **Single Sword** - HIT. Each unblocked Hit deals 1 damage to the target.
-   **Double Swords** – HIT + SPECIAL. Functions as a normal Hit but also triggers certain abilities that require a Double Sword result.
-   **Blank** – MISS. No damage is dealt.

### Rolling for Defense
The combat dice has 2 different possible outcomes when defending.
-   **Shield** – BLOCK. Negates 1 Hit from an Attacker. This symbol shares the same face as the Single Sword.
-   **Blank** – FAILURE. No Block is achieved. Double Swords count as blank on defense unless specified otherwise by an ability or item.

### Abilities (as Actions)
Instead of attacking, a Hunter may use their Action to trigger a non-passive ability or item. This includes:
- Healing abilities
- Buffs, Debuffs, or special effects
- Tactical skills with unique combat impact
Some abilities are conditional or have Cooldowns. Refer to the character card or rulebook section on Ability Cooldowns for details.

### Interrupts (Usage)
Interrupts are instant-use abilities that can be activated at any time, even during the enemy's turn.
- Use them reactively to survive, evade, or counter.
- Only one Interrupt may be used per Hunter per round unless otherwise noted.
See the Interrupts section for full rules and timing interactions.

### Passives
Passive abilities are always "on" unless the player chooses to toggle them off (when allowed).
- They provide ongoing bonuses or effects.
- Some passives may have conditions or triggers noted on the card.

### Attack Types
Attacks in Riddle of the Beast fall into three main categories: Melee, Ranged, and Special Abilities. Each offers unique strengths and limitations, and many enemies will require careful coordination to overcome.

### Melee
Melee attacks are close-quarters strikes that target enemies in adjacent spaces.
- The number of Attack Dice is shown on the Hunter’s character card next to the Melee icon.
- Melee attacks are Physical unless otherwise stated.
- **Engaging and Disengaging:** When two units are adjacent they are considered Engaged. If a Hunter attempts to leave melee range, they must Disengage and risk an Attack of Opportunity.

### Ranged Attacks
Ranged attacks cover everything from rifles and arrows to spikes fired by mutated beasts.
- Ranged stats appear as A/R, where:
    - A = Attack Dice
    - R = Range in spaces
- **Important:** If a unit uses a Ranged Attack while Engaged, they trigger an Attack of Opportunity.

### Special Abilities (as Attacks)
Special Abilities include powerful attacks like elemental blasts, mystical strikes, or explosive projectiles.
- They may affect single or multiple targets.
- Some are disabled by effects like Tricks of the Trade.
- Special Abilities can be Elemental or Physical.

### Beams
Beams are directional attacks (e.g., flamethrowers, shotguns) that hit all units in a straight line.
- Affects all targets (friend or foe) in the path.
- Roll Attack and Defense separately for each target.
- All Beam abilities have a 2-round cooldown unless used as an Interrupt or otherwise noted.

### Area of Effect (AOE)
AOE attacks strike a targeted space and all adjacent spaces.
- May damage multiple enemies or allies caught in the radius.
- All AOE abilities have a 2-round cooldown unless used as an Interrupt.

### Attack of Opportunity
If a unit:
- Moves out of melee
- Moves past an enemy
- Uses a Ranged Attack or Ability while Engaged
…it triggers an Attack of Opportunity.
- Roll 1 Combat Die.
- On a Hit, the unit takes 1 Damage (no Defense roll allowed).
- Units that are PARALYZED or DISARMED cannot make Attacks of Opportunity.
- Interrupts do not trigger them.
- **Note:** Only player-controlled units are vulnerable to Attacks of Opportunity.

### Critical Hits
Critical Hits represent devastating strikes that surpass standard damage.
To score a Critical Hit:
- The attack must roll all HITs (no Misses).
- You must roll at least:
    - 2 Attack Dice for Physical attacks
    - 3 Attack Dice for Elemental attacks
- Roll type (Single or Double Sword) does not matter—only that no blanks are present.

### PHYSICAL Critical Hits
- Most Physical Criticals have a x2 Multiplier.
- Status effects or abilities may increase this multiplier.
- Roll your Attack Dice again based off of Combat Multiplier.
- Add the new result to the original damage.

### ELEMENTAL Critical Hits
When an Elemental Critical is triggered, choose one:
- Keep your original roll, apply damage normally.
- Reroll your Attack Dice, and if you deal damage:
    - Ignore Armor
    - Defender cannot roll Defense Dice
- But if the reroll fails, no damage is dealt.
Elemental Crits are all or nothing—high risk, high reward.

### Perfect Defense
A Defender achieves Perfect Defense if they roll a total Defense Value of 3 or more.
- This negates all incoming damage, even if the attack exceeded 3.
- Elemental Critical Hits and abilities that disable defense ignore this rule.
- Units with a Defense score of 6+ cannot achieve Perfect Defense.

### Attack Value vs. Damage Value
- **Attack Value** = Number of dice rolled
- **Damage Value** = Final result after subtracting defense and applying modifiers
Critical Hits only multiply Attack Value, not final damage.

### Ability Cooldowns
Certain abilities and cards include a Cooldown (CD) period, representing the number of Rounds or Turns that must pass before the ability can be used again. Cooldowns introduce tactical depth, requiring players to manage timing, synergy, and resource flow across combat and exploration.

### How Cooldowns Work
- **Standard Duration:** Unless stated otherwise, most Cooldowns last 2 rounds.
- **Cooldown Starts:** The timer begins immediately after the ability is successfully used.
- **Cooldown Reduction:** Reduce the CD by 1 at the start of each Round or Turn.
- **Ready to Use:** Once the CD reaches 0, the ability becomes available again.

### Cooldown Rules
- **Beams & AOEs:** All Beam and AOE attacks have a default 2-round Cooldown, unless they have finite charges, or state a different CD directly on the ability or item card.
- **Independent Cooldowns:** Cooldowns are tracked separately for each ability. A character can use a different ability even if another is still cooling down.
- **Canceled Abilities:** If an ability is interrupted, canceled, or fails to activate, the Cooldown does not begin. The ability remains available for future use.
- **Interrupts with Cooldowns:** Interrupt abilities that have a CD may be reused indefinitely, as long as they complete their Cooldown after each activation.

### Interrupts
Interrupts are special abilities that can be used outside the standard turn order in a Combat Round. They allow Hunters to react to events—even during an opponent’s turn—granting powerful tactical flexibility. However, they are limited per round and follow specific rules for timing and use.

### Key Rules for Interrupts
1.  **Independent from Actions:** Interrupts do not consume a Hunter’s standard Action. A Hunter may still perform a Movement and Action on their turn while also using an Interrupt separately.
2.  **One per Round:** Each Hunter may use one Interrupt per round, regardless of whether it’s during their turn or another player’s. Interrupt usage resets at the start of that Hunter’s next turn.
3.  **Cooldowns (CD):** Some Interrupts have a Cooldown period and may only be used again once it reaches 0. Interrupts with Cooldowns are not consumed; once refreshed, they may be used again.

### Declaring an Interrupt
To maintain clarity and flow during combat, use the following steps:
1.  **Announce the Interrupt:** Clearly declare by saying: “Interrupt!” before the triggering event resolves.
2.  **Timing:** The player then activates the ability at the correct point.
    **Important:** Interrupts must be declared before the Attacker rolls their Attack Dice—they cannot be used in reaction to revealed results. Interrupts can target any valid unit within the range or scope of the ability.

**Example 3: Interrupts**
An enemy moves to Melee distance with Fei. The Player Declares “Interrupt!” (Yes he shouted.) Even though the Attacker has already moved adjacent to the Hunter, the Defender can now declare what Interrupt they will use and when in the Attackers movement path the Interrupt will be applied, as long as the target space is within range. Fei uses Paralyze and chooses it to be applied during the movement path as shown. The enemy is now unable to finish their movement or complete an action due to Paralyze.

### Strategic Tips for Interrupts
- **Save vs. Spend:** Interrupts are once per round—use them wisely. Don’t waste them on small threats unless the action is crucial.
- **Offensive or Defensive:** Some Hunters have multiple Interrupts. Do you use Michael’s Sneak Attack Interrupt to damage the enemy, or do you save it for a defensive Disarm? The decision could be the difference between life and death.

## Status Effects
Status Effects represent temporary conditions that boost or hinder a unit. They may come from abilities, attacks, or environmental effects. A unit can be affected by multiple Status Effects at once, unless stated otherwise.
There are two types of effects:
-   **BUFFS** - Positive effects that enhance a unit.
-   **DEBUFFS** - Negative effects that impair a unit. Multiple Debuffs can be used on the same target at once but will trigger Immunity from the same status effect for 1 turn.
-   **Immunity** - Any character afflicted with a Debuff is considered immune to that same type of status effect for 1 round after the effect ends. Certain Templates and units have natural immunity to specific Debuffs.

### Buffs
-   **Stealth** – Unit is treated as double distance (rounded down) when targeted by enemy Ranged Attacks or Abilities. Does not affect allies. Enemy AI logic also calculates from this increased distance.
-   **Cleave** – When making a Melee Attack, also hits all adjacent enemies. Roll Defense separately for each.
-   **Multi-Attack** – Re-roll 1 missed Attack die per round. If the re-roll is a HIT, it can trigger a Critical Hit.
-   **Berserk** – Re-roll 2 missed Attack dice. Stronger version of Multi-Attack.
-   **Wards** – Absorbs up to X total damage before affecting HP. A Ward of 2 will absorb the next 2 points of damage received.
-   **Cover** – When targeted by a Ranged Attack/AOE/Beam, roll 1 Combat die: MISS: Attack is ignored. HIT: Resolve attack as normal.

### Debuffs
-   **Paralyze** – Cannot move, act, or use Interrupts for 1 round. Enemies with multi-action Templates skip all actions this round.
-   **Immobilize/Slow** – Reduces Movement:
    -   Immobilize (X): Lose X Movement this round. Excess carries into next.
    -   Slow: Fixed Movement reduction for multiple rounds.
-   **Poison** – Roll 1 Combat Dice.
    -   HIT = Take 1 DMG, cannot defend.
    -   DOUBLE SWORD = Poison continues an additional round.
    -   MISS = Poison ends.
    -   Max Poison Damage = 4 per unit.
-   **Blind** –If the Target is attempting an action with a Range of 1, such as melee, they must roll a HIT to proceed. If they are attempting an Action with a Range value greater than 1 they must first roll a Double Sword.
-   **Disarmed** – Cannot make a Melee attack or Attack of Opportunity.
-   **Marked** – Enemies attacking the target may re-roll 1 missed attack die. Target cannot benefit from Stealth.
-   **Cursed** – Target cannot roll a Critical Hits or Perfect Defense.
-   **Wounded** – If a Wounded target takes damage from a Physical attack or Hemorrhage, that attack deals +2 additional damage. Multiple Wound effects do not stack.
### **Note: If the attack is blocked or reduced to 0, no bonus damage is applied.**
-   **Bleed** – Each point is tracked. Bleed can be reduced by healing effects. When Bleed reaches threshold (based on Template), target takes Hemorrhage Damage (see table) and all Bleed Points are reset to 0.
    -   **Hemorrhage** – Hemorrhage Damage cannot be reduced by Defense Rolls, Buffs, or Template effects, and cannot be increased by generic modifiers. Only Wounded, or Abilities and Items that specifically state they interact with Bleed or Hemorrhage, may modify the damage dealt. Undead are immune to Bleed and Hemorrhage.
    -   **Bleed Threshold Table:**
        | Template              | Bleed Points |
        |---------------|--------------------|
        | BASE                  | 3            |
        | UNDEAD                | N/A          |
        | CREATURE OF THE NIGHT | 3            |
        | MONSTER               | 4            |
        | CONDEMNED             | 4            |
        | BEHEMOTH              | 5            |
-   **Defense Debuffs** – Reduces DEF value (min 1). Multiple applications do not stack value but extend the duration of the strongest Debuff by 1 round.
-   **Tricks of the Trade** – Disables 1 Ability (not Melee, Ranged, Armor, or Template) for 1 round. Does not affect Signature Abilities. Target still acts, but must redraw an action. If same card is drawn, they lose their turn.
-   **Flinch** - Target suffers –1 DEF and takes +1 DMG from the next attack. Does not stack with itself.
-   **Fear** – Roll all Sanity Checks twice, take the lower result.

## Elemental Attacks
All attacks in Riddle of the Beast are assigned an elemental property that can potentially trigger different effects and potential greater/lesser damage based off of the defenders armor type or template. Certain elements have a Basic effect that always occurs when an enemy is targeted by it and a Special effect that only occurs under certain conditions.

### Physical
All Melee and Ranged Attacks are considered Physical (Earth) Element unless indicated otherwise by an equipped item. If an attack does not clearly indicate an element it should be considered Physical by default. Physical Attacks that score a Critical Hit process differently than all other elements. See Critical Hits for more details.

### Fire
The most destructive of the Primal elements and tied to the Astral South. The element of fire can burn and incinerate any touched by its raw energy.
-   **Basic Effect** – Target takes 1 extra point of damage. Damage is determined after the attack is already rolled but before Defense is rolled. Targets resistant to FIRE damage are immune to this extra damage.
-   **Special** - Roll 1 Combat Dice prior to the player rolling an attack of the FIRE element. If a Double Sword is rolled the target catches on fire and is considered BURNING. At the beginning of their next round they must re-roll the initial attack. This is considered Fire damage but does not retrigger Fire effects.

### Electricity
Electricity is the most profound manifestations of the Primal element of Air that is tied to the Astral East. Those who can control this graceful but devastating force can unleash an unavoidable onslaught.
-   **Basic Effect** – Target rolls 1 less defense when defending from this attack.
-   **Special** - Roll 1 Combat Dice prior to the player rolling an attack of the ELEC element. If a Double Sword is rolled the attack CHAINS to another target of the attackers choice that is within 4 spaces of the original target. If the attack is an AOE or BEAM roll separately for each target effected.

### Ice
Primal Water is often associated with its life giving effects but one must not ignore its potency for death and pain. Ice is the most common form of the deadly use of this element tied to the Astral West.
-   **Basic Effect** – Target suffers –1 Movement and –1 Damage output for 1 round.
-   **Special** - Roll 1 Combat Dice prior to the player rolling an attack of the ICE element. If a Double Sword is rolled the target is FROZEN for 2 rounds.
    -   **FROZEN** - Target cannot achieve Perfect Defense and physical Critical Hits against them gain +1X Multiplier.

### Ether
Ether is the positive energy or Yin that empowers life and binds together the Prime Elements of Fire, Electricity and Ice.
If an Ether attack successfully damages an enemy with the Creature of the Night/Undead/Condemned Template they are treated as a BASE Template for 1 round. See Templates for further details.
An enemy damaged by an Ether attack is considered PRIMED and any FIRE/ELEC/ICE Status effects targeting a Primed enemy triggers on a HIT. This lasts for 2 rounds.

### Nether
The Nether element is the negative energy that fuels death, destruction and decay, an abyssal void of nothingness that exists is in a state of metaphysical non-existence. The Nether can be a conduit formulated deep within the dark recesses of the psyche. Traumatic events and acts of extreme violence can formulate Breaches that connect to this great chaotic nothingness. But great and unimaginable dangers dwell within this void. These malevolent entities can be the gravest but most mysterious of forces and woe befalls any unfortunate enough to encounter them.
If an attacker deals at least 1 point of Nether damage to an enemy, the target cannot benefit from any healing effects until the beginning of the attackers next round.
Targets damaged by Nether suffer from DECAY for 2 rounds.
-   **DECAY** - Targets afflicted by Decay take +1 damage from all attacks.

## Templates
In Riddle of the Beast, some of the most dangerous enemies bear special Templates—unique traits that drastically alter how they fight, survive, and respond to Hunters. Templates affect things like:
-   How damage is calculated
-   Immunity or resistance to status effects
-   Extra movements or actions
-   Combat behavior and special triggers

-   **BASE** – Unless indicated otherwise all units are considered a Base template. This is considered a standard humanoid. Only Base units are vulnerable to Attacks of Opportunity in Skirmish Mode.
-   **NAME LEVEL** – A named level unit is experienced and difficult to pin down as they adapt quickly to changes in battle. If a Name Level unit is affected by a negative Status Effect they are immune to ALL Status Effects on the following round.
-   **UNDEAD** - An Undead character is only damaged when struck by a Critical Hit. All other attacks, regardless of damage inflict 0 damage to the Undead. Undead exposed to a Light suffer from the FLINCH status effect. This only applies to the first attack made against them that round.
-   **CREATURE OF THE NIGHT** - The Creatures of the Night template gain +1 DEF and the STEALTH buff when in Darkness. This is disabled when exposed to Light. Creatures of the Night draw 2 Combat Cards per round.
-   **MONSTER** – A creature with the Monster template only takes 1 point of damage for every 2 points of damage rolled when defending. This is rounded UP. Monster's draw 2 Combat Cards per round.
-   **THE CONDEMNED** - Condemned share the Monster and Undead template traits.
-   **BEHEMOTH** – The largest and most dangerous entities a Hunter can encounter come in the form of Behemoths. Gigantic monsters capable of sustaining great amounts of damage while tearing apart their foes. A Behemoth inflicts 2 points of damage for every 1 point of damage rolled after making a successful attack against an enemy target. A Behemoth only takes 1 point of damage for every 2 points of damage rolled after defense is calculated, this is rounded DOWN.
-   **THE GRIM** – The Grim Template marks the most dangerous killers, cursed monsters, and apex nightmares in the world of Riddle of the Beast. These foes don’t just attack—they respond. Unlike other Templates, Grim is a modular title. It can be applied in addition to another Template (e.g., Grim Behemoth, Grim Undying). Grim enemies gain Reaction Abilities that trigger only when a Hunter takes a specific action. The response is always targeted at the Hunter who triggered it. The Grim Rank determines the type of Hunter action that provokes a reaction and the effect that follows. (Grim Table reference implied, but not provided in detail here).

-   **THE UNDYING** – The Undying Template represents enemies that refuse to stay dead. These horrors—be they revenants, cursed abominations, or vengeful spirits—rise again after being defeated, forcing Hunters to adapt, exploit weaknesses, and finish the job correctly.
    ### Undying Mechanics
    1.  **Resurrection Check:** When an Undying enemy is reduced to 0 HP, they become Subdued until the start of their next turn. At the beginning of their next turn: Roll 1d6. If the result is equal to or less than their Undying Level, the enemy resurrects. Upon resurrection: Regain 1 HP per Undying Level. Act normally that round (they are no longer Subdued).
    2.  **Weakness:** Each Undying enemy has a specific Weakness (an Element, Status Effect, or Gear type). If the Subdued enemy is hit with their Weakness before the Resurrection Check: Their Undying Level is reduced by 2 (unless otherwise specified). This reduction is cumulative and may bring their Undying Level to 0. *Example: An Undying enemy with Level 3 and a Weakness to FIRE is reduced to Level 1 if hit by a Fire attack before resurrection.*
    3.  **Progressive Weakening:** Each time the enemy successfully resurrects, their Undying Level is permanently reduced by 1. This ensures that persistent pressure eventually kills them for good.
    4.  **Permanent Defeat:** An Undying enemy is permanently destroyed when: The Resurrection Check fails (i.e., roll exceeds their current Undying Level), or Their Undying Level is reduced to 0 by repeated Weakness triggers.
    5.  **Subdued State Rules:** While Subdued: The enemy cannot act, but can be attacked. They may roll Defense, but cannot achieve Perfect Defense. Hunters are encouraged to attack during this window to apply their Weakness. This is your window—finish them before they rise again. *Example 4: If a character drops an enemy with an Undying level of 3 to 0 HP the enemy is Subdued until the start of the enemies next turn. On the enemies turn the Resurrection check is rolled and if the result is 3 or lower the enemy returns to combat with 3 HP and will start their turn.*


## Armor and Damage
Armor in Riddle of the Beast plays a key role in survival—reducing incoming damage or influencing how attacks affect different targets. Every armor type has strengths and weaknesses, so choosing the right protection can change the course of battle.

### Hunter Armor
-   All Hunters begin with a basic armor type (no modifiers).
-   You can upgrade armor later through purchases or rewards.
-   New armor offers unique defenses but may come with vulnerabilities (e.g., strong against Ice, weak to Fire).

### Enemy Armor
-   Enemies often have specialized armor based on their nature (e.g., undead, fire-born, etc.).
-   These armors can:
    -   Reduce or amplify damage from certain elements.
    -   Grant status resistances or unique traits.
(Example Armor Types table implied, but not detailed here).

### Damage Resolution Steps
When resolving an attack, follow this simple flow:
1.  Roll Attack Dice & Count Hits.
2.  On a Critical Hit: Physical attacks roll extra dice. Elemental attacks bypass normal defense.
3.  Check Target Template: Some enemies (e.g., Wraiths) only take damage from Critical Hits.
4.  Apply Element vs. Armor: Check the Element of the attack against the target’s Armor type. Adjust damage.
5.  Apply Buffs/Debuffs: Add or subtract effects from active abilities or conditions.
6.  Roll Defense Dice: Subtract this value from total damage. Perfect Defense negates all damage.
7.  Apply Template Rules: Some Templates change how damage is finalized (Monsters/Condemned round up, Behemoths round down).
8.  Deal Final Damage.

## Character Cards
<!-- Placeholder for Character Cards Section, if it's meant to be a textual explanation -->
### Combat
Combat in Riddle of the Beast is fast-paced, tactical, and unforgiving. Every battle is a deadly dance of timing, positioning, and teamwork. Hunters must coordinate their abilities, manage resources, and anticipate enemy behavior to survive the horrors they face.
Each encounter unfolds in Rounds, with Hunters and enemies acting in sequence. Prepare your Hunters.
Study your enemies. The battlefield is a puzzle—and the wrong move could be your last.

### Combat Rounds
Combat is structured into Rounds, which repeat until the enemies are defeated or the objective is complete.
- Hunter Round: Players act with each Hunter.
- Enemy Round: Enemies act using Combat Cards and Combat Logic.
- End of Round: Resolve ongoing effects and prepare for the next round.

### Initiative Phase
At the start of combat, determine who acts first:
- One player rolls 1d6 for the Hunters.
- Roll another 1d6 for the enemies.
- Higher roll goes first; reroll ties.
This order remains the same for the entire battle.

### Hunters Round
During the Hunter Round, each Hunter may take the following steps:
- Move: Up to their Movement (MV) value.
- Action: Perform a Melee/Ranged Attack, use an Ability, or interact with the environment.
- Interrupt (Optional) – Use a stored Interrupt for a reaction or special ability (if available).
Players choose the order in which Hunters act. Once all Hunters have completed their turns, proceed to the Enemy Round.

### Enemy Round
Enemies act based on their Combat Cards and Combat Logic.
### Draw Combat Cards
- Shuffle the deck and draw 1 card per enemy.
- Enemies with specific Templates may draw 2 cards per round.
- Draw in ascending CP order (lowest CP enemies act first).

### Combat Logic
Each enemy prioritizes targets based on their Logic Tree:
Example: "MALE > CLOSEST > HIGHEST HP"
The enemy will attack a male Hunter if possible. If not, the closest target. If tied, the one with the highest HP.
**Players resolve enemy choices as fairly as possible.**
If the Combat Card includes Cruelty, it overrides Logic—the enemy attacks the Hunter with the lowest HP in range.

### Enemy Movement
- Melee enemies close the gap to engage.
- Ranged enemies maintain ideal distance.
- Enemies with AOE or Beam attacks will move to affect the maximum number of targets.

### Combat Cards
Combat Cards are the AI system that drives enemy behavior. Each card contains one of the following actions:
- MELEE – Basic close-range attack.
- RANGE – Basic long-range attack.
- SPECIAL 1 or 2 – Unique enemy abilities (status effects, terrain control, etc.).
- SIGNATURE – The enemy’s most devastating or thematic ability.
Signature cards are rare, but deadly. Be ready.

### Strategic Tips for Combat
- **Coordinate Your Team:** Combine Hunter skills to weaken enemies, protect each other, and set up combos.
- **Manage Resources Wisely:** Don’t burn Interrupts early—save them for Signature attacks or critical moments.
- **Study Enemy Logic:** Understand your opponent. Learn their Combat Logic to predict their movement and priorities.

### **What is the Beast?**
 ### Is it a mythical dragon or biblical ten horned behemoth; or perhaps it is a warning from those of days past to the many nightmares that truly exist beyond the scope of what our brittle and fragile psyches accept as normal. However, as I study the works of previous generations of hunters I find unease to see how many of our predecessors speak of the Beast. Not as if they are speaking of some creature or monstrosity, but as if they are referring to something much more horrific.

## Skills and Proficiencies
Riddle of the Beast includes several non-combat related skills that are available for each Hunter. To determine a skills success the player will roll the 6-sided dice (1d6) and add the Hunter's skill proficiency score to the roll. If the result is equal or greater than the requirement they are successful. Hunters can attempt a skill they are not proficient with but do not add any modifiers to the roll. Augment Gear can provide bonuses that increase the odds of success for a specific skill. Use these Augments to raise a Hunter’s skill to a higher Tier and gain the benefit of its proficiency skills.

**Sample Stat Block:**
(Sample Stat Block as provided)
The Ability Block provides details on the actions an enemy will take when drawing a corresponding Combat Card during their turn. These actions can include attacks, buffs, debuffs, or special abilities, making each encounter dynamic and unpredictable.

-   **Movement Toward Target:** The enemy moves a number of spaces up to their Movement (MV) value toward their designated target.
-   **Check Combat Card Action:** If the enemy’s drawn Combat Card allows them to take an Action (attack, buff, debuff), they will perform it. Ranged Special Skills can be used only if the target is within range when the ability is triggered.
-   **No Target in Range?:** If no valid target is in range, the enemy moves again up to their maximum Movement value toward their target and ends their turn.
Attacks are in Black. Buffs are marked in GREEN and Debuffs in RED.
### Abilities:

-   Special 2: Enemy uses their Special 2 Skill.

## Skirmish Mode (PVP)

### What is Skirmish Mode?
Skirmish Mode is a winner take all skirmish battle between 2 or more players. Each player chooses a number of units whose combined Character Points (CP) is equal to or less than the Total Character Points (TCP) agreed upon for the battle. Skirmish is a great way to familiarize yourself with the Combat rules. Try a Skirmish mode with each player controlling 1 Hunter as practice. Nothing builds friendship like killing your friends.
-   **TCP:** Decide on Total Character Point limit per team. An average battle is built around 1500 TCP per team. There is no limit however but the greater the TCP, the longer and more epic the battle. If agreed upon, multiple players can break off into teams and use a combined TCP. Skilled players may also choose to take a lower TCP value and compete with a handicap.
-   **Forge Map:** Each player can make their own battlefield or players can work in unison to make one giant battlefield. In campaign mode forge map according to guide.
-   **Select Characters:** Players should choose a selection of characters from the premade or custom creations to enter the battle without exceeding their TCP limit.
-   **Set Battle Order:** The Battle order should be set based off of whichever team has used the least amount of TCP during character selection. In case of ties, roll 1 DICE 6 (1d6) – Player with the highest roll goes first.
-   **Character Deployment:** Characters should be deployed at the corner closest to the player's play area.
-   **Battle for Victory:** Each player continues to utilize their deployed units following the Round Order below until all enemy units are defeated or surrender.

### Skirmish Mode Round Order
In this section you will find the basic round order that a player will follow when playing Riddle of the Beast’s Skirmish Mode.
1.  **Reset Cool Downs** - At the beginning of the players round, any of their abilities that are on cool down progress 1 round closer to being recharged and reusable. Most cool downs last 3 rounds after a successful use.
2.  **Reset Interrupts** - An interrupt is an instant action that can be used during a players round or during an enemies round. An interrupt does not count as the units action who possess the interrupt. However, each unit can only perform 1 interrupt per round. This is reset at the beginning of the players round. (Note: Interrupts are consumable and this is not reset at the beginning of the round, only the option to use available interrupts is reset. See Interrupts section for more details.)
3.  **Card Draw** - The active player now draws a card from the top of the Clash Card pile. Certain cards must be immediately played while cards with the HAND icon can be held by the Player and used as an interrupt at any point. These do not consume the interrupt actions of any of the player's units.
4.  **Movement/Actions** - The player can now choose to Move and/or commit an Action for each of their units. An Action can be a melee, ranged attack or the use an ability or item. Once all of a players units are finished their round ends.
5.  **Next Players Round** - Next player in the Battle Order starts on step 1.

### Skirmish Mode with Enemy Units
Players can choose to control enemy units found in the Horror Journal instead of using Hunters for a Skirmish Battle. Enemies from the Horror Journal function differently in Skirmish Battle and do not rely on Combat Cards to choose their actions. Instead they are chosen by the controlling player. Special skills and Signatures for these enemies function under the following rules in Skirmish Battles:
-   SPECIAL 1 Skills are all treated as an ACTION with a 2 round CD.
-   SPECIAL 2 Skills are all treated as an INTERRUPT with a 2 round CD.
-   SIGNATURE Skills are all treated as an ACTION with a 4 round CD
